To auto start a new service:

- Find out the name of service's script from /etc/init.d/ directory e.g. mysqld or httpd.
- Add it to chkconfig. sudo chkconfig --add mysqld.
- Make sure it is in the chkconfig. sudo chkconfig --list mysqld.
- Set it to autostart. sudo chkconfig mysqld on.

For ownchan-server-worker, for example use the commands with "ownchan-server-worker" instead of "mysqld".

Also, if you change the init-script afterwards, call systemctl daemon-reload after saving the changes to the init script.
